# Customer Churn Prediction in a Telecommunications Company

## Project Description

Development of an ML solution for predicting customer churn in a telecommunications company and combating it.

## Data

A PostgreSQL database with historical data about telecommunications company customers was available:
It consists of several tables:
- **contract** — contract information;
- **personal** — customer personal data;
- **internet** — information about internet services;
- **phone** — information about phone services.

## Stack

Python, SQL, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, PyTorch, CatBoost, Optuna

## Overall Conclusion

We have developed an algorithm that achieved an ROC AUC score on the test set exceeding 0.86. Model improvement is ongoing.
Business recommendations were provided to the client to prevent customer churn.
