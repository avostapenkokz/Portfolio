## Taxi orders prediction

### Project description

Development of ML solution for predicting the next hour's taxi demand in different areas of the city for surge pricing management.

### Data

About 10 million records of taxi trips in Chicago (open data from the City of Chicago website - [2022](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Transportation/Taxi-Trips-2022/npd7-ywjz) and [2023](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Transportation/Taxi-Trips-2023/e55j-2ewb)).

### Stack

Python, PySpark, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Docker

### Overall conclusion

The project was implemented using Docker containers and PySpark. Linear regression model trained on the additional features demonstrated performance metrics with Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 2.18.
